<h3 align="center"><code>A MISDIRECTION-DRIVEN OFFENSIVE TOOLKIT FOR COGNITIVE DISRUPTION</code></h3>

<p align="center">
  <b>zer0 DAYS later</b> is a psychological deception toolkit for red teamers, APT operators, and adversary simulation artists.<br>
  It hijacks the mind of defenders — flooding systems with false leads, injected IOCs, decoys, and noise.<br>
  Built for GitOps, CI/CD pipelines, and post-exfil ghostwalks.

## [ PHILOSOPHY ]

Traditional defense is overrun. Speed and misdirection now matter more than brute force.  
`zer0 DAYS later` is built for one purpose: **to manipulate perception**.

Every artifact is intentional. Every decoy is weaponized.  
This is not just post-exploitation — it’s cognitive warfare embedded directly into the operational flow.
